## Overview
This is a web application that generates randomized Kingdoms for the deck-building board game Dominion.
This project is built with Flask. 

This project also includes an ingest tool for processing Dominion-related data from the DominionStrategyWiki. See the section on the Ingest Tool below for more details

## Setup

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```

## Starting the DominionRandomizer Server 

run the manager script from the root diectory: ```python3 manage.py```

run unit tests: ```python3 -m unittest```

## Development

### Running Unit Tests

This Application utilizes unitteset. From the base directory, all tests can be run with the following command:
```python3 -m unittest```

A specific unittest module can be run as follows:

```python3 -m unittest tests.test_dominion_data```

### Ingest Tool

The Dominion Randomizer relies on stored datasets generated from custom backend ingest infrastructure. The ingest tool is the entrypoint for initiating ingest operations on the server.

TODO: elaborate on the tool's purpose as well as basic usage

## Techical Details: Application Layout

### /

core Flask & project files

#### /app

the Flask application. Notice the __init__ package constructor, which contains the application factory method (see section below).
This folder also contains view, templates, and other application resources.

##### /app/main

Within the flask app, the main folder houses the 'main' blueprint.  For more information about Blueprints, see the Application Factory section of this doc.



## Technical Details

### Application Factory (where is my app object?)

Perhaps where this project deviates from the most ubiquitious Flask setup is in using the application factory. In the most basic Flask setup, the appliction loop is invoked within the global scope, which limits dynamic configuation options. The factory pattern is a tool to allow the applicaiton to be invoked dynamically from different configuration contexts. This is important to enable unit testing as well as separation of intances across deployment environments. This pattern is described further by Grinberg [1].

#### Show me the Blueprints!

The application factory pattern necessitates implementation of Flasks Blueprint package-- because the app is no longer in the global scope, resources such as routes by default are created too late. Blueprints allow these resources to be declared in the global scope, in a dormant state until registered at runtime.

This is not the first Dominion randomizer. Although no source material is references, credit goes to the contributers of these various applicaitons for inspiration, and for countless moments of simplified Dominion setup <3
